# Backlog — known pending work

This file is the **single source of truth for documented known pending work** in NCode.Identity:
deferred decisions, feature gaps, and action items. It is durable, versioned repository content — not
an agent's volatile memory or a chat transcript.

**This catalog is not exhaustive.** It lists only work that has already been _identified_ and
deliberately written down — primarily durable storage for AI chat sessions and items a human asked to
record. Unidentified work, and pending work tracked elsewhere (issues, `// TODO:` comments, ADR
follow-ups, test gaps), also exists and is not necessarily duplicated here. Absence from this file is
not evidence that something is done or that nothing is pending.

**For contributors and automated agents:** when you identify pending/deferred/follow-up work during a
change, record it **here** (and, for a non-obvious _decision_, in an [ADR](docs/adr/)) rather than
leaving it only in chat history or agent memory. This follows
[ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-conventions-and-lessons-live-in-the-repository.md): conventions, reasoning,
and recurring work live in the repository. Code-local reminders may also use `// TODO:` comments; this
file is the catalog that makes those discoverable in one place.

Entry convention: a short title, one-line context, and (where useful) the touch points. Remove an
entry when the work lands (and note it in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) if user-facing).

## Deferred — evaluated, intentionally not-yet

- **UserInfo access auditing.** The UserInfo endpoint returns end-user PII but is not audited. A
  `userinfo.accessed` audit event would give a PII-access trail for compliance, but it is a read on a
  hot path (one event per request) and the subject is already captured at token issuance. Deferred as
  an opt-in; revisit if a compliance requirement needs per-access PII records.
  Touch points: `src/NCode.Identity.OpenId.Authentication/Endpoints/UserInfo/`,
  `IAuditEventRecorder`.

## Feature gaps — not yet implemented

- **End-session / RP-initiated logout endpoint.** No OpenID Connect end-session endpoint, session
  termination, or back-channel logout notification exists. Until it does, there is no logout operation
  to audit. (ID-token `sid` claim for logout is also not yet emitted.)
- **Consent persistence and enforcement.** The authorize flow negotiates `prompt` and audits the
  grant/deny decision, but there is no persisted consent record or scope pre-approval. See
  `// TODO: check consent` in
  `src/NCode.Identity.OpenId.Authentication/Endpoints/Authorization/Handlers/DefaultAuthorizeHandler.cs`.
- **`device_code` (RFC 8628) and CIBA grants.** Not implemented (TODOs in
  `src/NCode.Identity.OpenId.Authentication/Endpoints/Token/`).
- **`refresh_token_reuse_policy` (none / revoke_all).** Refresh-token replay is _detected and audited_
  (`token.refresh.replay`), but there is no configurable response that revokes the whole token family
  on reuse. See `// TODO: refresh_token_reuse_policy` in
  `src/NCode.Identity.OpenId.Authentication/Endpoints/Token/RefreshToken/DefaultRefreshTokenGrantHandler.cs`.
