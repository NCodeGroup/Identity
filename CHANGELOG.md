# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Versioning is stamped in lockstep across the family by
Nerdbank.GitVersioning ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-central-package-management-and-lockstep-versioning.md)); a breaking
change to the public API is a **major** version bump.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Shared tenant-resolution abstraction (`ITenantResolver` / `ITenantStrategy` / `TenantResolutionOptions` in
  `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Abstractions`, default implementation in `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Core`) so the OpenID runtime
  and the management API select the ambient tenant from a single source of truth. See
  [ADR-0017](docs/adr/0017-tenant-resolution-shared-abstraction-and-management-boundary.md).
- Optional tenant boundary for the management API (`ITenantBoundary`): when tenancy is request-derived
  (dynamic-by-host / dynamic-by-path), client-scoped resources outside the request's tenant scope return `404`; tenant
  and server administration remain central-admin (unscoped).

### Changed

- Collapsed the per-strategy OpenID tenant providers, their selector, and the thin tenant factory into a single
  `DefaultOpenIdTenantFactory` that composes `ITenantResolver` for selection and performs only tenant materialization.
  Tenant-selection option types moved from `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Authentication` to
  `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Abstractions` (`NCode.Identity.OpenId.Tenants` namespace); `OpenIdTenantOptions` now carries
  only materialization settings.

### Fixed

- The unique index on a tenant's domain name is now a filtered index (`WHERE NormalizedDomainName IS NOT NULL`), so
  multiple tenants may omit the optional domain name without colliding on relational providers.

- Adopted repository-wide engineering conventions: Central Package Management, Nerdbank.GitVersioning lockstep
  versioning, SourceLink-to-GitHub provenance with portable symbols, a scripted Definition of Done, CSharpier
  formatting, and scoped coding-convention instruction files. See [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).
