# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Versioning is stamped in lockstep across the family by
Nerdbank.GitVersioning ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-central-package-management-and-lockstep-versioning.md)); a breaking
change to the public API is a **major** version bump.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Shared tenant-resolution abstraction (`ITenantResolver` / `ITenantStrategy` / `TenantResolutionOptions` in
  `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Abstractions`, default implementation in `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Core`) so the OpenID runtime
  and the management API select the ambient tenant from a single source of truth. See
  [ADR-0018](docs/adr/0018-tenant-scoped-data-access-at-the-persistence-layer.md).
- Tenant-scoped data access for the management API: an `IAmbientTenantAccessor`
  (`NCode.Identity.OpenId.Persistence.Abstractions`) plus an `OpenIdDbContext` global query filter on tenant-child
  entities so that, when tenancy is request-derived (dynamic-by-host / dynamic-by-path), a resource outside the
  request's tenant is never materialized (a cross-tenant read returns `404`, closing the fetch-then-reject leak
  window). A reusable `TenantScopeEndpointFilter` establishes the scope; tenant and server administration remain
  central-admin (unscoped). See
  [ADR-0018](docs/adr/0018-tenant-scoped-data-access-at-the-persistence-layer.md).

### Changed

- Collapsed the per-strategy OpenID tenant providers, their selector, and the thin tenant factory into a single
  `DefaultOpenIdTenantFactory` that composes `ITenantResolver` for selection and performs only tenant materialization.
  Tenant-selection option types moved from `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Authentication` to
  `NCode.Identity.OpenId.Abstractions` (`NCode.Identity.OpenId.Tenants` namespace); `OpenIdTenantOptions` now carries
  only materialization settings.
- A managed client is always owned by the request's tenant, so `POST api/clients` no longer accepts a tenant
  identifier: `CreateClientRequest.TenantId` is removed and the server derives the owning tenant from the request
  (resolved for every tenant strategy, static-single included). This removes the redundant, error-prone echo of a
  tenant the server already resolved.

### Fixed

- The unique index on a tenant's domain name is now a filtered index (`WHERE NormalizedDomainName IS NOT NULL`), so
  multiple tenants may omit the optional domain name without colliding on relational providers.

- Adopted repository-wide engineering conventions: Central Package Management, Nerdbank.GitVersioning lockstep
  versioning, SourceLink-to-GitHub provenance with portable symbols, a scripted Definition of Done, CSharpier
  formatting, and scoped coding-convention instruction files. See [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).
